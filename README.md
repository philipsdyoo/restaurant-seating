# restaurant-seating

## Idea
One night on at a restaurant with my family in Manhattan, we were asked to wait up to 40 minutes for a table for four people. I wondered if there was an efficient way to seat people waiting in line so that waiting time can be minimized. I thought about First-In-First-Out, largest group prioritized, first best fit, etc. I wanted to make sure all people would get seated without other groups waiting too long and facing starvation much like process starvation when it is denied resources to do its work.

So I am creating a visual representation of what a random night would be like a small restaurant of 10 tables where each table can seat one or two people and groups larger than 2 must sit in a consecutive row of tables.
